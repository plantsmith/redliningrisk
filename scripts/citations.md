#### MODERN REDLINING DATA

Changes in neighborhood boundaries over the past century have obscured the full impact of redlining on environmental and health outcomes. To address the challenges of mapping historic HOLC ratings onto present-day neighborhoods, the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond used machine learning to determine how to optimally combine information on multiple ratings and classify present-day neighborhoods according to their 1930s HOLC grades.
